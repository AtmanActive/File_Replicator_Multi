# File Replicator Multi
Windows utility to update a bunch of scattered files from a tree of source files.

This program scans the selected source path for files, recursively, ignoring folders, and then iterates for each found to search for the same named file in the destination path, and, if found, overwrites the destination file with the source file.

If big source/dest trees are selected, the GUI will get unrensponsive until finished.

Inspired by File Replicator by Tyler Retelle (darklight_tr), but that works one-to-many, while I needed many-to-somewhere.
